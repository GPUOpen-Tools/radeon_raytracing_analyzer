How to generate a BVH trace
---------------------------

The first thing you will need to do is generate a BVH trace. Currently,
this is done via the Radeon Developer Panel. Please read the documentation
provided with this distribution for information on how to create a BVH trace.
This can be obtained from within the Radeon Developer Panel or from the link
on the Radeon Raytracing Analyzer “Welcome” view. The documentation is also
available online at:
