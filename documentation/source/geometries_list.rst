The Geometries Tab
------------------

The Geometries tab displays a read-only table of properties and statistics for
the geometries in the selected BLAS.

Above the table is the base address of the BLAS used by all the geometries, and the base
address of the TLAS containing the BLAS.

The following fields are displayed:

* Geometry index - The index of the geometry in the BLAS. This refers to the first column in the triangles table.

* Opaque - Presence of the opaque geometry flag.

* No duplicate any hit invocation - Presence of the no duplicate any hit invocation geometry flag.

* Primitive count - The number of primitives contained in the geometry.

The columns can be sorted by clicking on the column header. The arrow in the heading shows if
sorting is in ascending or descending order.
