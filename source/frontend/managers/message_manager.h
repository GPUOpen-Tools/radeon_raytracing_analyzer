/// @brief  Declaration for the MessageManager.
///
/// The message manager is used to send messages between panes and allow
/// for broadcasting of UI events. For example, if a resource is selected
/// in one pane, any interested panes can set up a connection for the
/// ResourceSelected signal and respond to it.
/// NOTE: The message manager should be used sparingly; if there is a direct
/// connection possible between a signal and slot, that should be used.
